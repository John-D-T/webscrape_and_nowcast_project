# Web Scraping and Now-casting Project 
This repository is to facilitate exploring the use of cinema data and web scraping techniques as an alternative economic proxy for economic activity in the UK (United Kingdom). The functionality includes:
 - `/twitter_scraper` web scraping twitter (utilizing python package Twint)
 - `/google_trends_scraper` web scraping google trends (re-purposing existing code, credit to https://medium.com/@isguzarsezgin/scraping-google-reviews-with-selenium-python-23135ffcc331 and https://towardsdatascience.com/scraping-google-maps-reviews-in-python-2b153c655fc2)
 - `/google_maps_scraper` web scraping google reviews 
 - `/imdb_analysis` code to process and analyse IMDb reviews (data sourced from Kaggle)
 - `/bfi_data_compile` code to compile 800 csv files containing weekly movie gross data in the UK
 - `/regression_analysis` code to generate linear regression using above data sources, then run linear regression violation checks
    - `/machine_learning` code to pass data into various machine learning models, to ultimately nowcast data.
- `/population_cinema_heatmap` using geospatial data to general a heat map of the UK

This is still a work in progress, so please bear with the lackluster documentation.
